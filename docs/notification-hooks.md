# Claude Code Notification Hooks

Findings from testing notification hooks in Claude Code.

## Configuration

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": ".*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/your-handler.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Notification Types

| Type | Trigger | Matcher |
|------|---------|---------|
| `idle_prompt` | After user prompt + response + 60s idle | `idle_prompt` |
| `permission_prompt` | Tool needs user approval | `permission_prompt` |
| `auth_success` | Authentication completed | `auth_success` |
| `elicitation_dialog` | MCP tool needs parameters | `elicitation_dialog` |

## idle_prompt Behavior (Tested)

**Trigger conditions:**
1. User sends a prompt
2. Claude responds (tool call NOT required, any response works)
3. 60+ seconds of idle time pass

**Firing behavior:**
- Fires once per prompt cycle
- Does NOT repeat automatically while idle
- Fires again after next user prompt + response + 60s idle

**Payload received:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "transcript_path": "/path/to/transcript.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/current/working/directory",
  "hook_event_name": "Notification",
  "message": "Claude is waiting for your input",
  "notification_type": "idle_prompt"
}
```

**Exit codes:**
- `0` - Allow notification (custom output shown in verbose mode)
- `2` - Suppress notification

## Current Implementation: AgentWire Integration

`~/.claude/hooks/idle-handler.sh` uses a two-pass idle system for worker panes.

**Two-Pass Idle System:**

1. **First idle**: Check if `.agentwire/{session_id}.md` exists
   - If no summary: Send instructions to create one, DON'T exit yet
   - Agent writes summary to `.agentwire/{session_id}.md`

2. **Second idle**: Summary file exists
   - Read the summary content
   - Queue notification with full summary content to parent
   - Kill the worker pane

**Summary file format** (`.agentwire/{session_id}.md`):
```markdown
# Worker Summary

[Context for follow-up]
```

**Features:**
- Uses `agentwire alert` for text-only notifications to parent
- Reads `.agentwire.yml` for voice, parent session config
- Auto-notifies pane 0 when in worker panes
- Notifies parent session if configured (orchestrator hierarchy)
- Skips chatbot sessions (conversational, not task-based)

**Hierarchy:**
```
parent orchestrator ← receives [ALERT from child] with full summary
    ↑ alert --to parent
child orchestrator   ← receives [WORKER SUMMARY pane N] from workers
    ↑ auto-notify pane 0
worker panes         ← write .agentwire/{session_id}.md on first idle
```

**Config example** (`.agentwire.yml`):
```yaml
type: claude-bypass
roles:
  - leader
voice: may
parent: main  # Notify parent session when idle (orchestrator only)
```

**For worker panes:**
- No `parent` needed (they auto-notify pane 0)
- Will write summary on first idle
- Will send summary to pane 0 on second idle, then auto-kill

## OpenCode Support

OpenCode uses a plugin at `~/.config/opencode/plugins/agentwire-notify.ts`:
- Listens for `session.idle` events
- Same two-pass idle logic as Claude Code hook
- Uses `sessionID` from event for unique summary file identification
- Calls `agentwire alert` for text-only notifications

## Notes

- Hook scripts need full paths to executables (PATH may not be set)
- Use `&` to background long-running commands
- Restart Claude Code after changing settings.json
- Debug logs:
  - `/tmp/claude-hook-debug.log` - Claude Code hook
  - `/tmp/opencode-plugin-debug.log` - OpenCode plugin
  - `/tmp/queue-processor-debug.log` - Queue processor
- Summary files: `.agentwire/{session_id}.md` (per-session worker summaries)
