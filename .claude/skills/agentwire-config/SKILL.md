description: Reference for `~/.agentwire/config.yaml` — main config structure including server/portal/SSL, projects, TTS/STT, agent, dev, services, executables, uploads/artifacts/wiki, channels (email/telegram/quo/sms/webhook/discord/slack), scheduler, worktree, overnight, session defaults. Use when editing or debugging agentwire config, setting up TTS/STT backends, wiring up a new channel bridge, or explaining config fields to the user.

# AgentWire Config (`~/.agentwire/config.yaml`)

## Layout of `~/.agentwire/`

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config.yaml` | Main config (see structure below) |
| `machines.json` | Remote machines registry |
| `scripts/` | Machine-specific helper scripts (TTS management, startup, etc.) |
| `voices/` | Custom TTS voice samples |
| `uploads/` | Uploaded images for cross-machine sharing |
| `artifacts/` | Agent-generated HTML for artifact windows |
| `wiki/` | LLM-maintained knowledge base (Karpathy LLM Wiki pattern) |
| `logs/` | Audit logs for damage-control |

Per-session config (type, roles, voice) lives in `.agentwire.yml` in each project directory (see `agentwire-project-config` skill).

## Machine Scripts (`~/.agentwire/scripts/`)

Each machine has a `~/.agentwire/scripts/` directory for machine-specific helper scripts (TTS management, startup hooks, service wrappers, etc.). This is the standard location — agents should look here first and put new scripts here.

Scripts in `~/bin/` should symlink to `~/.agentwire/scripts/` so they're callable from PATH but the source of truth is in one place.

These scripts are **not** managed by agentwire — they're local to each machine and not version controlled. They exist because different machines have different roles (GPU server runs TTS, Mac runs the portal, etc.) and need different glue scripts.
